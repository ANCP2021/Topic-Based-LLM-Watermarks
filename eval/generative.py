The generative attacks focuses on the generation of the text. 
One example is the emoji attack where emojis are generated after every space instead
of spaces to corrupt the green and red lists.

Goodside, R. There are adversarial attacks for that proposal as well â€” in particular, generating 
with emojis after words and then removing them before submitting defeats
